New members are welcome (see membership form). Benefits of chapter membership include a library of
gesneriad reference materials, access to rare and unusual gesneriads, and a source for hard-to-obtain
growing supplies. We hold an annual show where members display plants, provide information to
the public, and host a plant sale open to the public.


We encourage membership in [The Gesneriad Society](https://www.gesneriadsociety.org/), an international 
society devoted to the identification, culture, propagation, and conservation
of gesneriads.Â Its journal, Gesneriads, is published four times a year, and
its website includes extensive information about gesneriads. It also sponsors an annual convention hosted by a different chapter each year.
PSGS will host the convention in 2022.
