The Puget Sound Gesneriad Society (PSGS) is a chapter of the international Gesneriad Society. Both are non-
profit organizations that encourage the culture of plants in the gesneriad family. Our chapter meets ten
times a year* to exchange plants and information, enjoy a program about plants, hold a business
meeting, and participate in a plant raffle.

*Meetings are currently being held virtually. If you wish to attend a meeting or have further questions,
please [contact us](/contact/).
